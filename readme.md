# Mistake Middleware
The Mistake Middleware handles errors and exceptions by registering custom shutdown function, error handler and exception handler. When an error or exception is caught the middleware creates a log entry and prepares an error message that will be sent to the client before interacting with the pipeline by reseting the queue and telling the pipeline to only call middleware registered before the Mistake Middleware.

## Installation
This middleware is by default included in the [Phapi Framework](https://github.com/phapi/phapi) but if you need to install it it's available to install via [Packagist](https://packagist.org) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```shell
$ php composer.phar require phapi/middleware-mistake:1.*
```

## Configuration
There is one thing that can be configured for the Mistake Middleware; if error messages should be shown. This is handy to have enabled during development but **should be turned off in production** since an error message will be serialized and return to the client. (Default: off).

```php
<?php

// For development
$pipeline->pipe(new \Phapi\Middleware\Mistake\Mistake($displayErrors = false));

```

## Phapi
